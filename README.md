# Background of the Enterprise:
The enterprise is a small bakery that specializes in custom cakes and pastries called ABC cakes.

# Current IT Setup:
The ABC Cakes currently has a local server that hosts their website and manages their orders and inventory. They also have a few desktop computers and laptops for employees to use for various tasks such as managing orders and creating designs for custom cakes.

# Cloud vs non-cloud solutions:
One of the main advantages of cloud solutions is the ability to access data and applications from any device with an internet connection. This would allow employees of ABC Cakes to access the website and manage orders from their laptops or mobile devices, increasing their flexibility and productivity. In addition, cloud solutions typically offer scalability and can be easily expanded as the business grows. On the other hand, non-cloud solutions require more upfront investment in hardware and infrastructure and are typically more difficult to scale.

# Recommendation: 
Given the small size of ABC Cakes, a cloud-based solution would be the most appropriate for their IT infrastructure. In terms of service level, a managed cloud service provider would be the best choice, as it would provide the bakery with the necessary technical support and maintenance without requiring them to hire additional IT staff. As for the deployment type, a public cloud solution would be most suitable, as it would provide the bakery with the necessary flexibility and scalability.

# Justification:
A managed cloud service provider would be the best choice for the bakery, as it would provide them with the necessary technical support and maintenance without requiring them to hire additional IT staff. This would allow the bakery to focus on their core business and leave the technical details to the service provider. A public cloud solution would be most suitable for the bakery, as it would provide them with the necessary flexibility and scalability to meet the changing needs of their business. In addition, a public cloud solution would allow the bakery to only pay for the resources they use, reducing their overall IT costs.
